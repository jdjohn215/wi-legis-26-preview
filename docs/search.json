    "text": "The Stakes\n\nThe Assembly\nIn the State Assembly, all 99 seats are up for reelection. Currently, Republicans have the majority with 54 seats to the Democrats’ 45. In contrast to previous maps, this Assembly district map does not clearly benefit one party of the other. To illustrate: in 2024 both Donald Trump and Democratic US Senator Tammy Baldwin won narrow statewide victories; each of those victories constituted a majority in 50 Assembly seats. The reason Republicans actually won 54 Assembly seats is because of Republican incumbents fared a little better than Trump.\nIn 2026, Democrats need to win 5 districts to flip the Assembly. Their most straightforward path involves holding the single Democratic seat which Trump also won (the 94th), while flipping the 5 districts held by Republicans where Kamala Harris won (the 21st, 51st, 53rd, 61st, and 88th).\n\n\nThe Senate\nWisconsin’s 33 State Senators serve four-year terms, and their districts are divided into two classes. The 16 even-numbered districts are elected during presidential years, and the 17 odd-numbered districts are elected during midterm years (such as 2026). Because Wisconsin adopted new districts in 2024, no State Senate election has yet been held under these district boundaries.\nCurrently, Republicans hold a 3-seat majority in the legislature’s upper chamber, 18 seats to the 15 for the Democrats. Democrats need to flip two seats in order to achieve a majority. Practically speaking, they have three targets, the 5th, 17th, and 21st districts. Only one Democratic-held district (SD31) is expected to be seriously contested by the Republicans. Kamala Harris won all of these districts in 2024.",
